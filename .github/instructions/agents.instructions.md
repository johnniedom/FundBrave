# FundBrave Project Instructions
--> This project is named "FundBrave," a decentralized crowdfunding platform built with Next.js and TypeScript.
--> When explaining anything, be clear and concise, and avoid unnecessary technical jargon.
--> Always ask follow up questions to clarify user requests, when necessary.
--> Follow best practices for TypeScript and Next.js development.
--> Always add comments to explain complex logic in the code.

 ## Special Modes
--> **Plan Mode:** When asked to "Plan", break down the task into small, actionable steps.
    1.  Outline the architectural approach in plain text or pseudocode within the chat.
    2.  **Do not** output full code blocks during the planning phase.
